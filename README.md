# GANs-on-fashion-dataset
I have collected this dataset from internet sources which has customer images of apparels using GANs on this data set produces  new random clothing images
Sometimes being a fashion designer is not that easy. When presenting an outfit, it should be in the best light possible, best color, and pattern which requires a lot of patience and random ideas to put in. You will most likely have to change a lot of styles and techniques to design. However, data science solutions today have focused more on machine-learning. With that being said, a lot of these researchers have set their goals on fashion models.
the images generated will depend on the quality of data more data and computing power will generate better images this is what i have come up with the limited data of 5000 apparels

images generated after 40 epoches
